<h3>Probabilistic Programming for Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Amirabbas Asadi, <span>9 Oct 2024<span>, Sharif University of Technology</p>
<p>Bayesian Learning provides a natural framework for approaching Machine Learning problems. For a long time, due to the significant computational cost of Bayesian inference, this framework was limited to simple models and problems with a small amount of data. Probabilistic Programming is the fruit of many years of research in approximate Bayesian inference aiming to address these limitations. This presentation is a friendly introduction to Probabilistic Programming. We will explore how modern inference methods and recent advances in Differentiable Programming can help us unlock the full potential of Bayesian Machine Learning.</p>
